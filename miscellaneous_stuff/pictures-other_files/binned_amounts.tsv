these are the "weights"
sampo:  but I was thinking of just applying weights relative
 to the bin size to the TP, FP, and FN counts for each bin
  and then summing to take prec, rec, and F.
  
  "True positives. This is when a classifier correctly predicts the existence of a label."

  I have to manually count TP,FP,TN for each bin
  6 x 10 = 60 bins to count 

  To make this work almost "automatically" I could do the same bins
   I have now but also take the predictions
    and add to the same file -> DONE

    now I just have to do some calculations
    make if clause where it checks the annotation and the probability (if probability above or below threshold e.g., 0.5)
    -> then check whether they match and which it is and assign it to a list (the four possibilities)
    -> then save the numbers somewhere or read the bin weights and already do some calculations :D 
    all in all: does not sound too bad? unless I run into some random issues of course.
