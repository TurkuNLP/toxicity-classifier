# what would be the best way to do this, do I put "hybrids" as one label or do I take each of them as their own label
# I could actually do both! :D

# Topias had some code that made plots for this so I could use that lol

# I need to ask Filip about what to really do about the toxicity classifier, like how to verify the stuff 

# I sent you on email Topiases kandi which deals with the toxicity data. Please give it a look. 
# I think it would be interesting to take this a bit further and actually make a solid toxicity detector and evaluate the translations. 
# That said, I am not like 100% invested on toxicity data and would be also quite interested in summarization or other such

# Like how would I take it further and evaluate the translations?
